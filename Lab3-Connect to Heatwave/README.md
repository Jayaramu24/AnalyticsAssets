Scroll down to ‘Preview’ section and toggle the switch to ‘on’ for ‘Preview Redwood Theme’. Then just refresh the browser for both the ‘System Settings’ tab that you are in and also the main tab from where the ‘System Settings’ tab opened. This ensures that the ‘Redwood’ theme is successfully applied.
